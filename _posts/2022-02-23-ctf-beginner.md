# What is CTF?

There are many CTF introduction out there that you could search for with Google. But I'd recommend you checkingout [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A) to know about CTF generally.

# Now how do you participate in CTFs?

If you haven't played CTF even once, I recommend you try out [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) and [247CTF](https://247ctf.com/), first up just go on testing out all categories. If you don't know anything about linux, try out `General Skills` and [Bandit Wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) first, why? because Linux knowledge is mandatory. While playing you should realize which category suits you the most, hmm, then what can I say now? Follow your heart.

# Taking stepping stones in your favorite category

I'll recommend some website specialized for each category so you can do some training.

# So what do I do after stepped in a particular category?

Well, if you had reached a specific stepping stone without giving up then you must be very interested in your path/category. If you're that interested, then you will reach out for more yourself. Just don't give up and you'll be fine ðŸ§¸.
